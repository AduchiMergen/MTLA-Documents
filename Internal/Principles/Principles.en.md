# Principles of the Montelibero Association

We, the participants of the Montelibero Association, formulate the fundamental principles that guide decision-making
within the Association and describe our activities. These principles apply solely within the framework of the
Association, to its officials in the course of their duties, and do not regulate the personal beliefs of participants
outside of it.

## 1. Self-Ownership and the Non-Aggression Principle

We believe that people belong only to themselves. Therefore, we strive to expand the individual sovereignty of each
person. We adhere to the non-aggression principle and oppose aggressive violence, deception and coercion.

## 2. Freedom of Association

We support freedom of association both within and outside the Association. We preserve the right of any part of the
Association to secede and we develop fair and transparent procedures for dividing property and liabilities.

## 3. The Golden Rule and Equality

We treat others as we wouldn't mind to be treated. Every interaction should be equal and voluntary, as far as agreements
allow it, and responsibility should be proportional to the act.

## 4. Pluralism

We reject the monopoly on truth and acknowledge that our point of view is limited by our experience. We don't make
decisions on behalf of others and we respect their right to make their own choices.

## 5. The Importance of Local Communities

The development and security of Montelibero's territorial communities are a priority for us, as participants of the
Montelibero movement.

## 6. Creation

We change the world and create without waiting for permission or orders, and we eliminate obstacles to active
participation.

## 7. Subsidiarity and Decentralization

We distribute powers and responsibilities in the Association as much as possible without losing effectiveness. We do not
make decisions without the participation of those affected.

## 8. Openness

We strive for transparency in the Association's activities if it does not threaten the safety or privacy of people. We
maintain simplicity, conciseness and clarity in the Association's procedures and rules.

## 9. Ecology

We protect the environment, because we realize it affects everyone.

## 10. Solidarity

We recognize those who share these principles as our allies. We try to resolve conflicts within the movement by
accepting the presumption of good intentions of participants.
